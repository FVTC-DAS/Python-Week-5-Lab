# Week 5 Lab: For and While Loops (GitHub Classroom)

The goal of this lab is to get hands-on practice writing both `while` and `for` loops to perform repetitive tasks and solve common programming challenges.

## How to Use This Repository (GitHub Classroom)
1. Accept the Classroom assignment link and clone the repo to your computer.
2. Open the repository in VS Code (or your preferred editor).
3. Open **week5_lab.ipynb** and complete the tasks in the designated cells.
4. Run all cells to verify your outputs.
5. Save, then **commit** and **push** your changes back to GitHub.

## Tasks

Complete the single Jupyter Notebook named **week5_lab.ipynb**. Each task should be in its own cell or set of cells.

### Task 1: Countdown
- Use a `while` loop to count down from 10 to 1.
- After the loop finishes, print `"Blastoff!"`.

### Task 2: The FizzBuzz Challenge
- Use a `for` loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive).
- For each number, print one of the following:
  - `"FizzBuzz"` if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
  - `"Fizz"` if the number is only divisible by 3.
  - `"Buzz"` if the number is only divisible by 5.
  - The number itself if itâ€™s not divisible by 3 or 5.
- **Hint:** The order of your `if/elif` statements matters!

### Task 3: Sum of a Range
- Ask the user to enter a positive integer.
- Use a `for` loop with `range()` to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 up to **and including** the number they entered.
- Print the final sum in a user-friendly message.

## What to Submit
- Push your completed **week5_lab.ipynb** to this GitHub Classroom repository.
- Submit the link to your repo in Blackboard.
